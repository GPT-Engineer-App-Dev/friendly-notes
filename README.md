# friendly-notes

Create the basic structure for the note taking app with the following elements:

- A header with the app name
- A sidebar on the left where note categories/labels will go. For now just put a placeholder heading for "Categories"
- The main content area on the right should allow creating a new note via a button. 
- Clicking the new note button should display a modal dialog to enter the note title and content. 
- After entering title/content the new note should show up as a card in the main content area.
- Use a clean, minimal design with pastel colors.
